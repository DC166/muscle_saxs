Background subtraction and peak recognition for x-ray diffraction images of muscle

## A short introduction to diffraction peaks and their related structures

X-ray diffraction produces many peaks, each corresponding to a particular length of repeating structure in a particular orientation. This is an attempt to offer a brief guide to x-ray diffraction parameters.

X-ray peaks are frequently split into two general lines or areas, the equator and the meridian. The equator typically shows the strongest patterns and is the result of features which are orthogonal to the long axis of the thick and thin filaments (hereafter the radial direction). The meridian is perpendicular to the equator and has patterns which are the result of repeating structures along the long axis of the thick and thin filaments (hereafter the axial direction). Let's look at some specific diffraction peaks in each instance and talk about what gives rise to them:

### Equatorial direction 
* 1.0 diffraction line - arises from the spacing between two adjacent layers of thick filaments 
* 1.1 diffraction line - comes from the spacing between an actin layer and its adjacent myosin layer
* 2.0 diffraction line - comes from the spacing between an actin layer and its adjacent myosin layer

### Meridional direction
